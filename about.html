          <h3>About BeCoValent</h3>

          <p>
          Founded by Cambridge University researchers, BeCoValent is a unique platform designed to bring people together in a goal-oriented way.
          As researchers, we often found it hard to reach out to people in our community outside of our immediate workplace to team up for new projects, even though we knew that many like-minded individuals with right skills were working nearby. We found that the local aspect of team building is especially important in hands-on scientific projects, where distant collaborations or online resources are not always sufficient to set-up experiments together.
          However, BeCoValent is not only for scientists – building local sports teams of art groups can be equally challenging.
          BeCoValent combines features of social media with aspects of team management software, so that you can find and ‘bond’ with new users who have the right skills within the radius that is right for you, and track progress of your projects all in one place – whether personal or professional.
          Please note that BeCoValent is not primarily intended to be used for job searching. Any collaboration offers that require contractual agreements must be handled outside of the BeCoValent platform, and BeCoValent does not take any legal responsibility to oversee such contracts.
