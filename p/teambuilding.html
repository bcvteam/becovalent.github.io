            <h3>Team building</h3>

            <p>


  At BeCoValent, we aim to bring people with the right skills together to make personal and professional projects happen.
  Here are the main features that enable you to achieve that:
  Create your User profile
  Your User profile is a space to showcase your skills, ‘Professional’ or ‘Amateur’ - use the Skills Database to help you navigate. If your preferred skill is not listed, please make a suggestion and select a higher-level skill above it in the meantime - we will do our best to come back to you on your update request within 48 hours.
  Also, please select a personal and professional location, or both, where you can be reached for in-person collaborations. This can be changed and updated as many times as you need. We will never ask for a location that is more specific than your postcode for security reasons, but you can make it as broad as you want.
  Skill rating
  In addition to the self-rating of the skills as ‘Professional’ or ‘Amateur’, other users can rate your skills based on the experience they had working together with you. Only ‘Bonded’ users can rate each other’s skills. The skills with the highest rating will appear at the top of your skill list. If several skills have the same rating, or no rating at all, you can shuffle the order of their appearance on your skill list.
  You can move a skill between ‘Amateur’ and ‘Professional’ categories, but your rating will only appear in the new category if those who rated you Endorse it. They will be notified and invited to provide this Endorsement.
  Bond with other Users
  Once you specified the search radius and/or entered the desired skill (or selected one from our Skills Database), you can perform a search, whilst the ‘Bond’ function allows you to connect with the Users who have your skill of interest. The number of Bond requests is limited to 10 per week. Messaging Bonded users will help you ask questions and stay in contact. For more details about the messaging feature, refer to the Privacy & Security page (link to page).
  Create and manage Projects
  A Project is a space to keep track of your team progress that can be tailored and customised according to your team’s needs. With templates for Project timeline/Gantt charts, goal-setting, minute-taking, budgeting, and visual collage generation, as well as group messaging system, Projects will inspire you to get organised and creative, and use templates provided as much or as little as your Project needs.
  Projects can be made Private or Public.
  Titles and member lists of Private Projects are not visible to anyone who is not specifically invited to the Project by a Project Creator.
  Titles and member lists of Public Projects are visible to all Users, Bonded or not, during search or on pages of other users; however, contents of the Project are not visible unless a new User is accepted as a Project member by the Project Creators (Users with admin access, by default the User who creates the Project, but can be passed over; at least one Project Creator per Project).
  A search by a certain skill can return Public Projects in addition to individual users; Public Projects can also be suggested to Users within the radius specified by Project Creators.
  Also, recruitment ads for Public Projects can be placed on Community Noticeboards associated with relevant Skills in order to actively reach out to prospective members.

  Browse the Skills Database
  Skills Database is a unique resource that summarises various Skills in the fields of Art, Science, and Sports. Navigate the Skills Database to add all Skills that apply to you on a personal or professional level, and which you would be willing to contribute to a group Project, to your User profile. You can also search for Users with specific skills on a Map using the ‘Search’ function.
  If your preferred skill is not listed, or if you think there is a mistake in our Skills Database, please make a suggestion and select a higher-level skill above it in the meantime - we will do our best to come back to you on your update request within 48 hours.

  Search using the Map
  You can use our interactive Map to search for relevant Users based on their Skills, Locations, or both. If multiple Users have your Skills or interest in a certain Location, you will be able to compare between the Users based on the other Skills they have.
  If no Users match your search criteria, the Map will provide you with suggestions to either expand your search radius or search for Skills that are close to your Skill of interest based on our Skills Database.
  Public Projects can also be searched for on the Map.

  Engage with the Community
  Each high-level Skill has an associated Community, where Users can ask questions, share updates relevant to the field, and post Public Project ads.
  You can see Communities associated with all high-level Skills by selecting those Skills in the Database; in addition, each User will see a personalised Community Noticeboard based on the Skills they added to their profile. You can hide notifications from selected Communities associated with your Skills if you prefer to do so.
